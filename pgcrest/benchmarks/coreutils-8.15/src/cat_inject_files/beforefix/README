forget to reserve Makefile and cat_inject.c
difference is in old Makefile we just runcrest "./cat -" without any opt
but in cat_inject.c symbolicate the opt by CREST_int(c)

but that doesn't work because when iteration equals to 1000 ,only the
first opt be used.

so in the new Makefile we put manually other options 
and in cat_inject.c remove the symbolication of opt (just delete CREST_int(c)

NOTE: if we want to know how many test cases that really cover path ,we will counting in the future,but the different option can have almost same test cases
 , so if needed just roll back to old Makefile and count how many cover, should this right?
